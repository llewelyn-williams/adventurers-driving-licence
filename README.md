# Adventurers Driving Licence

A short multiple choice RPG adventure simulating a tongue-in-cheek "driving test" for budding stereotypical role play adventurers. 
The player is one of these budding adventurers and is "tested" and awarded their specific licence based on their choices.

**The live project is available on GitHub Pages: [Adventurers Driving Licence](https://llewelyn-williams.github.io/adventurers-driving-licence/)**

## User Experience Design


### Strategy

The game intended to be an amusing distraction. With the premise being based on personality quizzes but framed as a spoof-like fantasy game it should appeal to anyone who has some familiarity with fantasy games.

Users will expect interactive elements to be obvious in their purpose and respond in an expected way when used. Ultimately through the use of the interactive elements users should see changes that are based on their specific interactions. While due to the personality quiz like convention, results might be precisely as expected but any amount of unexpected result should form part of the amusement.


### Scope

For a user to want to interact with the game it should meet the following:
 - Be quick loading
 - Intuitive
 - Provide immediate feedback
 - Be visually clear and well laid out
 - Give the user a reason to continue playing

The target is a game that continually makes the next move for the player obvious, allows them, always provides feedback when they interact and can be accessed via different devices (mobile, tablet, PC).

#### User Stories

| Scenario | Requirements  |
|----------|---------------|
| **As a player**, I want to be able to jump right in and start playing right away. | The game mechanics should be based on previously well understood conventions or fully explained in clear language when something new is introduced. |
| I want to feel confident that my input is being received accurately. | A combination of forms of feedback should be presented when input is received to make it very clear what the user is submitting.|
| I want to be able to have some control over non fundamental game elements such as background music. | A settings section within the menu to allow the user to control these types of elements. |
| **As a returning player**, I want to be able to pick up where I left off. | The capability to save progress. Either manually or automatically.|
| I want to be able to refresh myself on any parts of the game I mightâ€™ve forgotten about. | Provide a guide from within the menu.|
| **As player who has completed the game** , I want to see a record of what I have achieved. | A different display to indicate completion and a record of what has been achieved is accessible from within the menu. |

### Structure

Three main content areas can provide the functions required.
1. The game area, where images and text are displayed along with interactive elements and access to menus
2. A menu area where settings can be accessed
3. A credits area, where attribution can be provided from within the game itself.

### Surface

Design choices are reminiscent of the medieval tavern theme often found in fantasy settings, mixed with older (90s) RPG videogame aesthetics.
